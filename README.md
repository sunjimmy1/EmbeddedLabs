# EmbeddedLabs
This respository contains the Labs for Introduction to Embedded Systems. Lab 3 deals with reading from the ADC and modulating a PWM signal based on the readings. Lab 4 consists of more exercises modifying the frequency and duty cycle of PWM signals. Lab 5 consists of reading from 1 or more analog sensors.
